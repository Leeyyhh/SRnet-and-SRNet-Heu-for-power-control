We provide the dataset Train-(0, 3)dB-λ for training and Test-(0, 3)dB-λ for testing.

The traning dataset (fading channel samples) and test dataset used in this code should be saved in the  folder 'train' and 'test' respectively.

you can download the dataset for 3 cells: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Tbm41j_rMWvr2yjnwnQTcg  password：7x53
 
we provided you can download the dataset for 3 cells: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Tbm41j_rMWvr2yjnwnQTcg  password：7x53
 
 
you can download the trained DNN model and get results directly for 3 cells: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Oej-hAHEzcGvAFOdPGdC5g  password：ucf3 . Please unzip the compressed package to a folder with the same name and put the folder in the directory of the code.

you can download the dataset for 7 cells lambda=1: https://pan.baidu.com/s/13CD1T3YC_RXhwlxIAGbzXQ  password：6g40
you can download the dataset for 7 cells lambda=5: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OT09Ne1MIpc3jVmo_F5r7w  password：rc53

 
(Due to the large amount of data and large trained model for 7 cells, the file is too large to upload. We only provide data sets in the two cases of lambda=1 and 5. You can request the unprovided data set through the email provided above and based on the parameters provided in paper, you can get the results easily.)
