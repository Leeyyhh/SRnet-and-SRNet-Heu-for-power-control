This code is for our paper:

Yinghan Li, Shengqian Han, Member, IEEE, Chenyang Yang, Senior Member, IEEE "Multicell Power Control under Rate Constraints with Deep Learning," 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We provide the dataset Train-(0, 3)dB-λ for training and Test-(0, 3)dB-λ for testing.

The traning dataset (fading channel samples) and test dataset used in this code should be saved in the  folder 'train' and 'test' respectively.

you can download the dataset for 3 cells: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Tbm41j_rMWvr2yjnwnQTcg  password：7x53
 
you can download the trained DNN model and get results directly for 3 cells: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Oej-hAHEzcGvAFOdPGdC5g  password：ucf3 . Please unzip the compressed package to a folder with the same name and put the folder in the directory of the code.
